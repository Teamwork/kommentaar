# Set default response types. With this, you can just use:
#
#   // Response 400: $default
#   // Response 404: $default
#
# Instead of referring to the full types every time.
#
# The syntax is the same as regular Response lines, minus the Response keyword:
#   [HTTP code] [(optional Content-Type)]: [type]
#
# Examples:
#default-response 400: github.com/teamwork/validate.Validator
#default-response 404 (application/json): github.com/teamwork/apiutil/errorhandler.Error
default-response 418 (application/teapot): net/mail.Address
